# Log

- **Looping through an Entire List**
  - for loop: ```for <variable> in <list>:```
  - variable only exists within the loop
- **Avoiding Identation Errors**
  - for needs to be followed by a **colon** and the loop needs to be indented
  - Python throw and identation error if the loop is not indented and if there is identation where it should not be
- **Making Numerical Lists**
  - **Using the range() Function**
    - Syntax: ```range(start, end, step)```
  - **Use range() to Make a List**
    - Syntax: ```list(range(start, end, step))```
    - Or within a for loop to generate a list with append and desired values
  - **Simple Stadistics with a List of Numbers**
    - min, max and sum functions: take the values of the list as arguments.
  - **List Comprehensions**
    - Is the same of a for loop but in one line
    - Syntax: ```var = [<expression> for <variable> in <list>]```
- **Working with Part of a List**
  - **Slicing a List**
    - Syntax: ```<list>[start:end]```
    - If start is not defined, it starts from the beginning
    - If end is not defined, it goes to the end
    - Both can be empty, to get the whole list
    - Can also use negative indexes
  - **Looping through a Slice**
    - I can loop through a slice of a list using the slice syntax
    - To loop in a subset of the list
  - **Copyng a list**
    - with the `=` operator, and ``[:]`` to copy the whole list
    - If we only use the `=` operator, we are only copying the reference to the list, although the list is the same. So is the same list with two names.
- **Tuples**
  - Not mutable lists
  - Syntax: ```<tuple> = (<value1>, <value2>, <value3>)```
  - If need a tuple with only one element, need to add a comma after the value
    - ```<tuple> = (<value>,)```
  - The loop is the same as a list
  - We can redifine the whole tuple, but not the values
- **Styling Your Code**
  - Python Conventions.
  - **The Style Guide**
    - PEP: Python Enhancement Proposals
      - Python is meant to be readable
      - We actually use PEP 8
  - **Identation**
    - 4 spaces
    - Use spaces instead of tabs
    - Parameters at the same vertical line
  - **Line Lenght**
    - 80 for code and 72 for comments, but even 100 is fine
  - **Blank Lines**
    - To separate parts of the code between sections

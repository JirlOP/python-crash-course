# Log User Input And While Loops

- **How the input() Function Works**
  - Pauses the program and waits until ENTER is pressed.
  - Take a prompt as an argument.
  - String is returned.
  - **Writing Clear Prompts**
    - If have a large input, use ``var += prompt`` to make large prompts.
  - **Using int() to Accept Numerical Input**
    - Just cast the input to an integer.
  - **The modulo Operator**
    - `%`
    - To find even or odd numbers.
    - To do a circular list.
  - **Introducing while loops**
    - Run while is true
    - **The while loop in action**
    - **Letting the User Choose when to quit**
      - Python doens't run the program if we compare a string that not was initialized. For example, if the user use ENTER without typing anything, the program will crash.
      - So initialize the variable with a empty string before.
    - **Using a Flag**
      - I preder this way, because let the code be versatile.
      - And is testable.
    - **Using break to Exit a Loop**
      - While always is true, but we can use a break to exit the loop.
      - In any loop.
    - **Using continue in a Loop**
      - Skip the rest of the loop and go to the next iteration.
- **Using a while loop with lists and dictionaries**
  - **Moving Items from One List to Another**
    - Syntax: `while list1:`
      - Run until the list is empty.
      - Use `pop()` to remove the last item from the list.
  - **Removing All Instances of Specific Values from a List**
    - Erase all the intances of a repeated value.
    - Use while loop with remove of the value.
      - Syntax: `while 'value' in list:` with `list.remove('value')`
  - **Filling a Dictionary with User Input**
    - Use a while loop to populate a dictionary with user input.
    - Works to add messages to designated users.
